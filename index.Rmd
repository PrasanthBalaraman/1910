# **Statistics**

Before the begining of 20th century, statistics meant observed data and descriptive summary figures, such as mean, variances, indices, etc., computed from data. With the introduction of Chi-squared test for goodness of fit by Karl Pearson (1900) and _t_ test by William Gosset (Student, 1908) from drawing inference on the mean of a normal population, statistics started acquiring new meaning as a method of processing data to determine the amount of uncertainity in various generalizations we may make from observed data (sample) to the source of data (population)

The major steps that led to the establishment and recognition of statistics as a seperate scientific discipline and an inevitable tool in improving natural knowledge were made by Ronald Aylmer Fisher during the decade 1915-1925. Most of the concepts and methods introduced by Fisher are fundamental and continue to provide the framework for the statistical theory. Fisher's work is monumental, both richness and variety of ideas, and provided the inspiration for phenomenal developments in statistical methodology for applications in all areas of human endeavour during last 105 years.
